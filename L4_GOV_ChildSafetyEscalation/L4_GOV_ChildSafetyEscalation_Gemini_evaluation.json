  "summary": "The documentation for the Gemini app does not meet the Governance Level 4 standard for child safety escalation. While there are some content filters and user reporting mechanisms in place, there is a lack of comprehensive protocols, escalation procedures, and established relationships with law enforcement. Improvements are needed in defining risks, establishing SLAs, and implementing staff training."
