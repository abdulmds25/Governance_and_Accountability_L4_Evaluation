    "code_of_conduct": {
      "score": 2,
      "evidence": "The document references Google's AI Principles, which serve as a 'living constitution' guiding responsible AI development. It mentions policies for generative AI prohibited use and outlines ethical guidelines.",
      "gaps": "While the document mentions consequences for violations in the context of prohibited use policies, it lacks explicit details on enforcement mechanisms for the broader code of conduct."
    },
    "roles_responsibilities": {
      "score": 2,
      "evidence": "The document describes the consolidation of Responsible AI efforts under Google DeepMind and the Trust & Safety team, indicating clear roles and accountability structures.",
      "gaps": "The document could benefit from more detailed descriptions of specific roles, such as an AI Ethics Board or Chief AI Officer, and their decision-making authority."
    },
    "training_programs": {
      "score": 1,
      "evidence": "The document mentions the importance of continuous learning and adapting protections, but does not provide specific details on training programs or requirements for staff.",
      "gaps": "There is a lack of detailed information on training content, target audiences, frequency, and assessment components."
    },
    "implementation_evidence": {
      "score": 2,
      "evidence": "The document provides examples of applied research, risk assessments, and adversarial testing as part of the AI Responsibility Lifecycle, indicating implementation of responsible AI practices.",
      "gaps": "While there is mention of monitoring and compliance mechanisms, more explicit documentation of process integration with the development lifecycle would strengthen this criterion."
    },
    "enforcement_accountability": {
      "score": 1,
      "evidence": "The document discusses internal controls, red teaming, and external monitoring, suggesting some enforcement mechanisms.",
      "gaps": "There is limited information on specific consequences for violations, auditing processes, and whistleblower mechanisms."
    },
    "integration_coherence": {
      "score": 1,
      "evidence": "The document outlines a lifecycle approach to AI responsibility, indicating some integration of codes, roles, and training.",
      "gaps": "The document lacks explicit connections between these elements and regular review processes. Alignment with external standards is mentioned but not detailed."

  "strengths": [
    "Comprehensive AI Principles guiding responsible development.",
    "Clear accountability structures with consolidated roles.",
    "Evidence of applied research and risk assessment practices."
  ],
  "weaknesses": [
    "Lack of detailed training programs and requirements.",
    "Limited information on enforcement mechanisms and consequences.",
    "Insufficient integration and coherence across documentation elements."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Develop and document specific training programs with clear requirements and assessments.",
    "Enhance enforcement mechanisms with detailed consequences and auditing processes.",
    "Improve integration by explicitly connecting codes, roles, and training, and aligning with external standards."
  ],
  "summary": "The documentation partially meets the Governance Level 4 standard, with strong AI principles and accountability structures. However, it lacks detailed training programs, enforcement mechanisms, and integration across documentation elements. Addressing these gaps would enhance the overall governance framework."
