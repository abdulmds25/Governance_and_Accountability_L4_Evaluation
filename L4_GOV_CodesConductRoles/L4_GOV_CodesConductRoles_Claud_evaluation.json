    "Comprehensive set of principles inspired by international human rights and industry best practices.",

  "weaknesses": [
    "Lack of a formal code of conduct specifically for AI development.",

    "Develop and publish a formal code of conduct for AI development with clear consequences for violations.",

  "summary": "The documentation partially meets the Governance Level 4 standard. While it provides a robust framework for AI safety and scaling, it lacks a formal code of conduct and documented training programs. Enhancements in these areas would strengthen its alignment with the L4 standard."
